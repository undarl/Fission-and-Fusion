[Fission and Fusion](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Fission%20and%20Fusion) updated for 0.18 until [undarl](https://mods.factorio.com/user/undarl) gets a [round tuit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/round_tuit).

Note that to migrate a save from "Fission and Fusion" (note the spaces) to "Fission-and-Fusion", you will need to extract "Fission and Fusion_0.4.4.zip" from within "{{MOD_NAME}}_{{VERSION}}.zip" and add it to your mods folder.

# Fission and Fusion

Adds portable fission generators, radioisotope thermoelectric generators, and factory-level fusion power as well as altering portable fusion reactors and increasing their research difficulty. Each branch of this mod can be toggled on and off individually in the mod startup options.

## Portable Fission Power
**Portable Nuclear Reactors:** Two-thirds the size and power output of portable fusion reactors, these run off of portable fuel cells created in much the same way as the full size fuel cells used in nuclear reactors.

**Portable Uranium Fuel Cells:** Much smaller and less efficient than full size nuclear fuel cells, but they also require fewer overall resources to create.

## Radioisotope Generators

**Radioisotopes:** These non-fissionable byproducts have a chance to be returned when reprocessing any kind of nuclear fuel cells. While they aren't useful for making new fuel cells, the heat of their decay can be harnessed by RTGs.

**Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators:** Maintenance-free energy sources for equipment powered by the heat of decaying radioisotopes. Not as efficient as reactors, but a step up from solar panels. The standard version has low power output but will last for decades; the fast version provides much more power initially but expends most of its energy within weeks.

**Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Arrays:** An array of standard RTGs designed to provide factory-level power.

## Fusion Power

**Heavy Water:** Water rich in deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, it can be separated out of large amounts of normal water via distillation or hydrogen sulfide exchange in a chemical plant.

**Deuterium Gas:** Gaseous deuterium, derived from heavy water via electrolysis in a chemical plant. It is used as fusion fuel -- directly by fusion generators, indirectly by IFE reactors, and in compressed form by portable fusion reactors.

**Deuterium Pellets:** Pellets of cryogenic deuterium created in a chemical plant, used as fuel by IFE reactors.

**Inertial Fusion Energy Reactors:** The first available fusion power option, these reactors fuse deuterium pellets to generate heat which is then used by heat exchangers and turbines in the same way as nuclear reactors. Temperature and remaining fuel data are available to the circuit network via a panel on the front of the reactor.

**Magnetic Conversion Fusion Generators:** These more advanced facilities fuse deuterium gas directly, and produce electricity using direct energy conversion. They are not as powerful individually as IFE reactors, but they are somewhat smaller, more efficient, and require no other power generation infrastructure.

**Portable Fusion Reactors:** The pinnacle of fusion technology so far, these reactor-generator units are small enough to fit in powered armor and run very efficiently on compressed deuterium gas.
